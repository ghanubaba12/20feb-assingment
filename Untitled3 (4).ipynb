    "Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "ans-GET and POST are two HTTP methods used for sending data to a server. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource (e.g., a webpage, an API endpoint).\n",
    "It sends the data as part of the URL in the form of query parameters (e.g., http://example.com/path?param1=value1&param2=value2).\n",
    "GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, and they are generally considered safe and idempotent (i.e., making the same GET request multiple times should produce the same result).\n",
    "POST:\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by a specified resource (e.g., a form, an API endpoint).\n",
    "It sends the data in the request body, separate from the URL.\n",
    "POST requests are not cached or bookmarked, and they are generally considered non-idempotent (i.e., making the same POST request multiple times may produce different results if the server modifies the data).\n",
    "In summary, GET is used for retrieving data, while POST is used for submitting data. GET requests are generally safer and can be cached, while POST requests are not cached and are generally considered less safe due to the possibility of modifying server-side data.\n",

    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "ans-In Flask, a template is a file that contains HTML, along with placeholders for dynamic content that will be provided by the Flask application at runtime. Templates allow web developers to separate the presentation logic (i.e., the HTML and CSS) from the business logic (i.e., the Python code that generates the data to be displayed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine to render templates. Jinja2 allows for complex expressions, control structures, and filters, making it easy to build dynamic, data-driven web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render a template and return the resulting HTML to the client. The function takes the name of the template file as its first argument, and any additional keyword arguments are passed to the template as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the render_template() function might be used in a Flask view function:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",

    "def index():\n",
    "    name = 'Alice'\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html', name=name)\n",
    "In this example, we have a simple Flask application with a single view function that renders an index.html template. The name variable is passed to the template as a keyword argument, and can be used in the template to generate dynamic content:\n",
    "\n",
    "php\n",

    "<html>\n",

    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "In this template, we use the {{ name }} placeholder to insert the value of the name variable that was passed to the template. When the render_template() function is called, Flask will replace the {{ name }} placeholder with the actual value of the name variable, resulting in the following HTML:\n",
    "\n",
